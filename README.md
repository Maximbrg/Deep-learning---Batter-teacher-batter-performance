# Deep-learning---Batter-teacher-batter-performance

The goal of the final exercise is to evaluate the performance of Deep Learning ensemble
methods that were published in the professional literature that werenâ€™t covered during the
course.
In the following project, we will conduct experiments in three algorithms. Random Forest that we used as our baseline, algorithm from https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05551, and our own improved algorithm.
