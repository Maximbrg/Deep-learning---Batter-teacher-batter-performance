# Deep-learning---Batter-teacher-batter-performance

The goal of the final exercise is to evaluate the performance of Deep Learning ensemble
methods that were published in the professional literature that werenâ€™t covered during the
course.  
In the following project, we will conduct experiments in three algorithms. Random Forest that we used as our baseline, algorithm from https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05551, and our own improved algorithm.

# Files:
base_algorithm - the random forest algorithm experiments + data preperation.  
A More Tolerant Teacher Educates Better Students.ipynb - the deep learning algorithm from the paper by yang(2019) and our improvement + friedman test.  
results.xlsx - experiments results (for each data set 10 fold cross validation) + average results (4 spreadsheets)

# Instructions
For running this code, please follow the instructions:

1.  Change the path of "data_folder_path" veribal to path where the data exsits in cell 3
2.  Run "A More Tolerant Teacher Educates Better Students.ipynb" or "base_algorithm"
